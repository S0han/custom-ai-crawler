My background in Electrical Engineering, spanning 4+ industries, has honed my problem-solving skills and heightened my ability to understand and improve complex systems. These qualities have fueled my success as a developer.\nI am seeking opportunities to enhance my skills further while delivering high-quality products and scalable web services. I'm passionate about Web and IoT applications and enjoy kickboxing, running, and weight-lifting in my free time.\n  * [](https://www.thekaneologist.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/kane-pereira-a0a72b168/>)\n  * [](https://www.thekaneologist.com/<https:/github.com/S0han>)\n  * [](https://www.thekaneologist.com/<https:/www.youtube.com/channel/UCxw8k9eiovb4fZ1gHCHr5Ng>)\n  * [](https://www.thekaneologist.com/<https:/www.udemy.com/user/mark-malook/?srsltid=AfmBOoriCLAj26AL-mEq8cXGT79REIPcD4BCTzBuz5v1vF0eZKqy7Uhk>)\n  * [](https://www.thekaneologist.com/<https:/x.com/thekaneologist>)\n  * \n\n![Profile Picture](https://www.thekaneologist.com/assets/images/kane_profile_pic.png)\nSKILLS\n## LANGAUGES\n  * JavaScript\n  * HTML\n  * CSS\n  * Python\n  * Dart\n  * C++\n  * C\n  * MATLab\n  * SASS\n  * Go\n  * PHP\n\n\n## FRAMEWORKS / LIBRARIES\n  * React.js\n  * Next.js\n  * Node.js\n  * Express.js\n  * TypeScript\n  * Flutter\n  * Jest\n  * Vitest\n  * Laravel\n\n\n## DATABASES\n  * MySQL\n  * SQLite\n  * Firebase\n  * MongoDB\n\n\n## OTHER TOOLS\n  * Postman\n  * Heroku\n  * Git\n  * Prisma ORM\n  * Jira\n  * Confluence\n  * Teamcity\n  * Figma\n  * XCode\n  * Android Studio\n  * Arduino\n  * Raspberry Pi\n\n\nPROJECTS\n[![Fullstack & Cyber Security - Threat Tracker App](https://www.thekaneologist.com/assets/images/aspis-fsd.png)](https://www.thekaneologist.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7297631611028656128/>)\nFULLSTACK & CYBER SECURITY - THREAT TRACKER APP\n[Site](https://www.thekaneologist.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7297631611028656128/>)\n[Code](https://www.thekaneologist.com/<https:/github.com/S0han/Threat-Tracker>)\n  * JavaScript\n  * HTML\n  * CSS\n  * PSQL\n  * React.js\n  * Node.js\n  * Express.js\n  * Postman\n\n\nI built a fullstack application that ties in cybersecurity principles using React.js and Express.js. The application requests a user to log in and get authenticated using producing a JWT. Once a valid JWT is generated the user can then login and use the API to pull cyber threat data which is peristed in PSQL. App features pagination logic and password encryption for easy UI and user account security. \n[![Form Builder React.js + Laravel + PSQL](https://www.thekaneologist.com/assets/images/deep-seek.png)](https://www.thekaneologist.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/posts/kane-pereira-a0a72b168_deepseek-javascript-fullstack-activity-7291342284359356416-5F5H/>)\nCREATE A FORM BUILDER USING DEEPSEEK + REACT.JS + LARAVEL\n[Site](https://www.thekaneologist.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/posts/kane-pereira-a0a72b168_deepseek-javascript-fullstack-activity-7291342284359356416-5F5H/>)\n[Code](https://www.thekaneologist.com/<https:/github.com/S0han/react-php-form-builder>)\n  * JavaScript\n  * HTML\n  * CSS\n  * PSQL\n  * React.js\n  * Postman\n  * PHP\n  * Laravel\n\n\nI created custom from builder using React.js, Laravel and PSQL. In this project I use DeepSeek to aid in the backend development to see whether it can help me bridge the gap between FE and BE as I have never used Laravel before.
